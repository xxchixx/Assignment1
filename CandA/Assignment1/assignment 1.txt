mov
jmp
nop (I did not mentioned it during today's class, it is the No Operation or do
nothing. You may remember it from our very first machine code program.)
a (register A)
x
y (x, and y are also registers, we will use them later)
numbers in decimal notation (positive integers (and zero) at minimum, but
you can add the possibility to recognize negative integers as well)
numbers in hexadecimal (they must start with 0x or 0X)
, [ ] (comma and brackets)
newline
whitespace should be ignored
anything else sould be recognized as a syntax error
Opcodes, registers and hexadecimal numbers must be
recognized in both upper and lower case.
The actual value of the numbers must be converted to a
variable (type: int) and also printed.
Also write at least two test cases.
A test case contains an input file, and an expected
output file. Then the compiled program can be tested
like this:
./a.exe < testinput.txt
and we can compare the output with the expected output.
The solutions must be uploaded to your groups github repo,
or your personal github repo.
